# cosmo_swg_bib
SKAO Cosmology SWG AASKAII Chapters bibtex.

Contains bibtex entries for the SKAO Cosmology SWG chapters for the upcoming AASKAII book so they can be cross-referenced consistently amongst chapters.

Please update these via pull request with your title and author list as they are constructed.

**DO NOT CHANGE** the entry key (e.g. `@article{cosmicshearchapter`) so others can use them consistently. This hopefully will just involve pasting (and repasting) the list of entries into your existing `.bib` files.

Entries look like:

```
@article{cosmicshearchapter,
    author = "Ian Harrison and others",
    editor = "Hartley, P. and others",
    title = "{Weak Lensing with SKAO: Cosmic Shear Cosmology}",
    eprint = "",
    archivePrefix = "",
    primaryClass = "",
    doi = "",
    journal = "",
    volume = "AASKAII",
    pages = "",
    year = "2025"
}
```
